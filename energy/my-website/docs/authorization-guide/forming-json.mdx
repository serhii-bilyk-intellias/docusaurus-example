# Forming the JSON Web Token payload

To form the JSON Web Token, the following information is required:

- Your Emulate retailer ID, provided by Emulate.
- A customer identifier. This should be an identifier that can be used by the retailer to look up a customer. It is how customers can be located in the Emulate portal, which can be used by retailers for customer support.

- For each facility (meter) of the customer:

  - The retailer's identifier for the facility
  - The address
  - The price area (for example, SE1); this is essential for spot price optimization
  - Optionally, the location (latitude and longitude) of the facility; if not provided, Emulate will geocode the address
  - Optionally, the ID of the power grid of the facility (will be required for local intraday trading)

Except for the Emulate retailer ID, you will need to write code to obtain these values from the retailer's customer database. **For testing purposes, it is of course possible to use fake data - but we recommend only doing this in the stage environment!**

The JSON Web Token's payload should be a JSON object formed as indicated below:

```json
{
  // The audience (a fixed string indicating the JWT is for Emulate; you
  // should send it exactly as shown here.)
  "aud": "https://api.emulate.network/",
  // Your Emulate retailer ID
  "retailer": 1,
  // An expiration time for this JWT, in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
  // Optional, but recommended, otherwise the token is valid forever.
  "exp": 1649773792,
  // Your ID for your customer.
  "customer": "23421",
  // An array of at least one facility (location where the customer has a
  // meter).
  "facilities": [
    {
      // Your ID for the customer's facility.
      "id": "ABC1323",
      // The address of the facility.
      "address": "Sankt Petri kyrkogata 7, 222 21 Lund, Sweden",
      // The price area of the facility
      "price_area": "SE3",
      // Optionally, the coordinates of the facility.
      "location": {
        "lat": 55.7063455,
        "lng": 13.1913016
      },
      // Optionally, the ID of the power grid that the facility is on.
      "grid_id": "LND"
    }
  ]
}
```
